Welcome to the Business Card Design repository! 
Business cards remain a vital tool for networking and business interactions despite the digital age. 
In essence, business cards are more than just a piece of paper—they are a powerful networking and marketing tool that helps establish and maintain professional relationships.
Visual Elements:
Color Palette: I used Cognorise’s brand colors to ensure consistency and brand recognition.
Typography: Clean and modern fonts to maintain a professional yet approachable feel.
Layout: A balanced and intuitive layout that makes the information easily accessible.
This project was a fantastic learning experience, and I’m thrilled with how it turned out.
